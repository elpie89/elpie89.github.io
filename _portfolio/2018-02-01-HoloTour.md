[HOLOTOUR project page](http://www.holoforge.io/work/holotour)

HoloTour is a virtual immersive experience that makes you able to visit extraordinary locations in the world like Rome and Peru.

In this project, I had the opportunity to work directly with Microsoft engineers.
The goal for my team was to convert the original Hololens HoloTour into a VR application ready to be launched on the window store the of the official Mixed Reality Headset release.

Mainly responsibilities were:
- Upgrade project from Unity 5 to Unity 2017 
- Shader upgrade and conversion for the new Mixed Reality Device
- Bug fixes all over the application, especially on general graphic glitches.
This work was a direct collaboration with a team of tester from Microsoft.
- Support on the entire team, mostly explaining Unity logic and behavior on some advanced features.
