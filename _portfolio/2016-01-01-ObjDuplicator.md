This character is Lovecraft, one of the four main characters of The Steampunk League.
I modeled this character following both the concept, both the old 3d, in fact this model is a Revamp
The character had already been previously modeled by another person and then rigged by me.
However, it was decided to do it again and this is my version
Obviously everything was sculpted and textured in ZBrush, ritopologgizzato Topogun and then rendered in the Marmoset, before being sent inside Unity
