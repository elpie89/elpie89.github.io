BGC Engineering Inc., LOOOK and HoloForge, partnered to transform communication in the mining and geoengineering sectors using Microsoftâ€™s HoloLens technology. The two firms have developed a proof of concept application that turns traditional flat engineering drawings and data into interactive 3D maps and immersive landscapes.

During this Project I had the possibility to work with Hololens for the first time.
Since the first day I arrived in team Asobo Studio explained me the idea around the Immersive view.
It has been a real change for me because I had to optimize everything , inside this scene.
I was completely surprised about the technical requirements of Hololens but in the and we have shipped the project as initially designed.

I have been responsible of:
- Immersive view

    Since the HoloForge division of Asobo studio was initially composed only of 3 people there was no proper 3D artist, so I had to cover this role from since the begging of the project.
    BGC gave us some cad file and the coordinates of the "intervention" zone in US.
    Using mostly Maya and Photoshop I made the Immersive view on the last sequence of the video.
- Creation and optimization of custom shaders
- Animation of UI elements
- Lighting
- Application frame rate

    Probably the biggest challenge, especially for this project, has been the immersive view, and his framerate.
    But in the end the goal of 60 fps per second has been achieved
