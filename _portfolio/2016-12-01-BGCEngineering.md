BGC Engineering Inc., LOOOK and Holoforge, partnered to transform communication in the mining and geoengineering sectors using Microsoftâ€™s HoloLens technology. The two firms have developed a proof of concept application that turns traditional flat engineering drawings and data into interactive 3D maps and immersive landscapes.



During this Project I had the possibility to work with Hololens for the first time.

I have been responsible of:
- integration of 3d assets
- construction of the vr view 
- creation and optimization of custom shader inside the applicaion
- createtion of the animation 
- lighting of scenes
- make sure the application play at 60 fps
