During the development of this application , I had to face different problem relative to performance of UI.
The main challenge was to integrate a lot of UI elements with very different animations.
I made this project using Unity sprites instead UGUI and a tween system in favor of the classical Animation/Animator system
The result was a really optimized application that play at 60FPS.
After this experience I decided to keep only the tween system because the Sprite workflow doesn't leave to much freedom to artistic side
Especially in a production time of 2 months. 

It was the opportunity to continue to develop inside the team SDK, what I call a master shader.
A shader full of extended features that are not included inside the built in unity shaders
This approach leave the possibility to develop new features gradually on every project ,
Without losing important production time but at the same time pushing the quality higher from project to project.

Responsibility:
- integration and development UI
- integration of 3d assets
- creation and optimization of custom shaders
- creation of the animation 
- make sure the application framerate is 60fps
