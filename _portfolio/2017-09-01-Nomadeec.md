During the development of this application, I had to face different problems relative to the performance of UI.
The main challenge was to integrate a lot of UI elements with very different animations.
I made this project using Unity sprites instead of UGUI and a tweening system in favor of the classical Animation/Animator system
The result was a really optimized application that plays at 60FPS.
After this experience, I decided to keep only the tween system because the Sprite workflow doesn't leave to much freedom to the artistic side
Especially in a production time of 2 months. 

It was the opportunity to continue to develop inside the team SDK, what I call a master shader.
A shader full of extended features that are not included inside the built-in unity shaders
This approach leaves the possibility to develop new features gradually on every project,
Without losing important production time but at the same time pushing the quality higher from project to project.

Responsibility:
- integration and development UI
- integration of 3d assets
- creation and optimization of custom shaders
- animations 
- make sure the application framerate is 60fps
