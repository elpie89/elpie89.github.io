The biggest challenge on this project was to find a way to display a 3d scanned object of 13,5 millions polygons inside a Hololens application

Using a combination of Maya, Zbrush, Sympligon and Turtle Bake Renderer this challenge has been accomplished 
I'm really proud of this job because it was originally estimated on 4 weeks of full work for one man.
The originally idea was to model everything in low poly(crazy).
Thanks to this workflow I reduced the modelling time in 2 days and 3 other days were used to unwrap properly the UVs

I will write a more detailed article in next days, on how to face this type of problem.

As always I have been responsible of:
- Performance check, be sure that the application play at 60 fps
- Manage assistant,and be sure his work was properly integrated into application
- Instruct the UI designer and Motion designer of proper workflow to reduce production time
- Creation of Unity utilities, to leave freedom to the artist on the artistic side of the project
